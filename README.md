# Cooperative Training Projects

This repository contains a collection of front-end projects created during my cooperative training. Each project is organized in its own folder with a brief README highlighting the idea and technologies used.

## Contents
- **Individual Project Folders:** Each folder contains a specific project with its own documentation.
- **Front-End Focus:** Projects showcase skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern front-end frameworks.

Happy exploring!
